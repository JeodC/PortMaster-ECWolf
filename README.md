- [Wolfenstein 3D / Spear of Destiny](https://www.gog.com/en/game/wolfenstein_3d) - Place all `.WL6` files in the `ecwolf/wl6` folder and all `.SOD` files in the `ecwolf/sod` folder.

 ## Play

 A Love2D launcher is planned, avoiding multiple `.sh` files. ECWolf does support mods, instructions for mods are pending however.
